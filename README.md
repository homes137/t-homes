# t-homes

This project orientates on the Vue Docs covering introductional examples of the Vue ecosystem to create a portfolio-like website.
There is no road map in my backlog, so it'll mostly be work-in-progress. The main focus indeed is the version-control and documentation, so thoughts are carried or dropped as they develop, aiming for a more structured coding exprerience. 

# Git
It could be the case, that branching/forking is an overkill to start with a project made by one person, but we'll see how it plays out.
